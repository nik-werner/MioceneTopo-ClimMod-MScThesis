### Background
The Miocene (23.02 - 5.33 Ma) was a period during the Cenocoic relatively warmer compared to today. Although most of the continental configurations have reached present day status by that time, active topographic changes were still ongoing. While also many modern genera and species had already evolved, some areas of the world experience major transitions during Miocene. Especially in the tropics and subtropics vegetation changed from forested areas to steppe with the according rise of C4 grasses during the late Miocene. These pronounced changes resulted in cahnges in faunal composition, in particular in Africa. The paleontological record shows at least three major faunal transitions in central/east Africa, which is also the cradle of the first hominins in the late Miocene/early Pliocene. However, so far the faunal changes observed in the geological record and perhaps resulting evolutionary pressures on early hominin ancestors could not be fully explained. While CO2 levels were higher during the Middle Miocene Climate Optimum (MMCO) they tempered down, reaching close to modern levels towards the end of the Miocene. However, generally warmer global air and sea surface temperatures than today have been reconstructed for this period. Also Earth System Models (ESMs) struggle to reproduce Miocene conditions reconstructed from proxies. However, it has been suggested that topographic changes, for instance the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau and the still open Panama Gateway, may have had fundamental impacts on atmospheric and ocean ciruclations, changing the climate in yet unknown manners. Among the areas of change was East Africa, were the East African Rift System (EARS) started to be uplifted by the African Superswell (Steinthorsdottir et al. 2021). 

### Rationale
In this thesis I will use the EC-Earth3 ESM with a dynamic vegetation component to model the african climate during the Miocene. Based on dyanmic topography of the African superswell modelled by Moucha and Forte (2011) I change the african topography accordingly to use it as boundary condition for the ESM. I will analyize the output in terms of circulation patterns and moisture transport and try to interprete the resulting vegetation and perhaps thereby faunal changes in this light. I will also take into account the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau, initializing the indian summer monsoon and perhaps draging moisture away from East Africa, changing the local climate. I will also try to estimate in how far the Miocene can be used as a future analog, due to topographic changes.
